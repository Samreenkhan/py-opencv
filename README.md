Py-opencv
=========

OpenCV examples written in python. Simple to the point example written in python.

## Author && Writting

This repos is developed and maintainted by [Patrick van der Leer][patvdleer]. My main language is not Python and I am NOT an expert in OpenCV. Since the trouble I had learning and understanding OpenCV (especially by using Python) I decided to write examples to help other people (and myself) with OpenCV as well as Python. This is written in my (very) small amount of free time I have left so it could take a while for this project to take shape. Any help is welcome.
